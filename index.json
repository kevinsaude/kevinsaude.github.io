[{"authors":null,"categories":null,"content":"I\u0026rsquo;m currently doing research at The University of Limerick under the supervision of Dr. Rory Costello, on the origins and consequences of Negative Partisanship in Europe between 1989-2024.\nThe aftermath of the 2007-2016 decade of crises has sparked academic interest in the role that negativity plays in electoral politics (i.e. Affective Polarisation/Negative Partisanship) against the background of increasingly polarised party systems and dealigned electorates. My research aims to further our understanding of emerging patterns in partisan politics in Europe.\nMy PhD dissertation is entitled \u0026ldquo;The mobilising effect of Positive and Negative Partisanship in conditions of multidimensional elite polarisation in Europe between 1989-2024\u0026rdquo; and completion is expected in Summer 2025.\nDuring my PhD, I was fortunate to gain immensely satisfying teaching experience, including as module leader and lecturer in courses related to comparative European politics and European studies.\nMost recently, I have been involved in a fantastic project aimed at harmonising and archiving over 40 Irish electoral studies datasets alongside Dr. Jos Elkink, UCD, Ireland, which will soon be available on a dedicated platform. I was also fortunate to work under the supervision of Prof. Jane Suiter in DCU, Ireland on two papers on deliberative minipublics as part of the EUCOMMEET project. This involved the analysis and dissemination of two survey experiment papers.\nFinally, I try to keep sane by performing in musical theatre and choral singing. I am also an experienced indoor cycling instructor, and I regularly am Master of Ceremony for various events.\n\r Download my CV here.\n","date":-62135596800,"expirydate":-62135596800,"kind":"term","lang":"en","lastmod":-62135596800,"objectID":"2525497d367e79493fd32b198b28f040","permalink":"https://kevinsaude.github.io/author/kevin-saude/","publishdate":"0001-01-01T00:00:00Z","relpermalink":"/author/kevin-saude/","section":"authors","summary":"I\u0026rsquo;m currently doing research at The University of Limerick under the supervision of Dr. Rory Costello, on the origins and consequences of Negative Partisanship in Europe between 1989-2024.\nThe aftermath of the 2007-2016 decade of crises has sparked academic interest in the role that negativity plays in electoral politics (i.","tags":null,"title":"KÃ©vin SaudÃ©","type":"authors"},{"authors":null,"categories":null,"content":"\r\r Table of Contents\r What you will learn Program overview Courses in this program Meet your instructor FAQs  \r\rWhat you will learn  Fundamental Python programming skills Statistical concepts and how to apply them in practice Gain experience with the Scikit, including data visualization with Plotly and data wrangling with Pandas  Program overview The demand for skilled data science practitioners is rapidly growing.

You can focus on the content and Academic handles the rest.\nHighlight your code snippets, take notes on math classes, and draw diagrams from textual representation.\nOn this page, you\u0026rsquo;ll find some examples of the types of technical content that can be rendered with Academic.\nExamples Code Academic supports a Markdown extension for highlighting code syntax.

You can enable this feature by toggling the math option in your config/_default/params.toml file.\nTo render inline or block math, wrap your LaTeX math with $...$ or $$...$$, respectively.\nExample math block:\n$$\\gamma_{n} = \\frac{ \\left | \\left (\\mathbf x_{n} - \\mathbf x_{n-1} \\right )^T \\left [\\nabla F (\\mathbf x_{n}) - \\nabla F (\\mathbf x_{n-1}) \\right ] \\right |}\r{\\left \\|\\nabla F(\\mathbf{x}_{n}) - \\nabla F(\\mathbf{x}_{n-1}) \\right \\|^2}$$\r renders as\n$$\\gamma_{n} = \\frac{ \\left | \\left (\\mathbf x_{n} - \\mathbf x_{n-1} \\right )^T \\left [\\nabla F (\\mathbf x_{n}) - \\nabla F (\\mathbf x_{n-1}) \\right ] \\right |}{\\left |\\nabla F(\\mathbf{x}_{n}) - \\nabla F(\\mathbf{x}_{n-1}) \\right |^2}$$\nExample inline math $\\nabla F(\\mathbf{x}_{n})$ renders as $\\nabla F(\\mathbf{x}_{n})$.\nExample multi-line math using the \\\\\\\\ math linebreak:\n$$f(k;p_{0}^{*}) = \\begin{cases}p_{0}^{*} \u0026amp; \\text{if }k=1, \\\\\\\\\r1-p_{0}^{*} \u0026amp; \\text{if }k=0.\\end{cases}$$\r renders as\n$$f(k;p_{0}^{*}) = \\begin{cases}p_{0}^{*} \u0026amp; \\text{if }k=1, \\\\\n1-p_{0}^{*} \u0026amp; \\text{if }k=0.\\end{cases}$$\nDiagrams Academic supports a Markdown extension for diagrams.
