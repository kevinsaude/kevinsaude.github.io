[{"authors":null,"categories":null,"content":"I\u0026rsquo;m currently doing research at The University of Limerick under the supervision of Dr. Rory Costello, on the origins and consequences of Negative Partisanship in Europe between 1989-2024.\nThe aftermath of the 2007-2016 decade of crises has sparked academic interest in the role that negativity plays in electoral politics (i.e. Affective Polarisation/Negative Partisanship) against the background of increasingly polarised party systems and dealigned electorates. My research aims to further our understanding of emerging patterns in partisan politics in Europe.\nMy PhD dissertation is entitled \u0026ldquo;The mobilising effect of Positive and Negative Partisanship in conditions of multidimensional elite polarisation in Europe between 1989-2024\u0026rdquo; and completion is expected in January 2026\nDuring my PhD, I was fortunate to be offered teaching roles, including as module leader and lecturer in courses related to comparative European politics and European studies.\nMore recently, with Prof. Jos Elkink (P.I.) we have been working on the Irish Election Studies Archive (IESA), which is an initiative which brings together Irish election datasets into a single, accessible online repository built on a harmonised coding scheme and a unified codebook structure. To date we have recoded and merged over 35 datasets covering elections between 1989-2025. I also gained a great deal of experience from working under the supervision of Prof. Jane Suiter in DCU, on two papers on deliberative minipublics as part of the EuComMeet project. This involved the analysis and dissemination of two survey experiment papers.\nOutside of academia, you may well come across me at large-scale running events across the country as Master of Ceremony. I have also been a Spinning instructor for many years, and I am a member of the Killaloe Male Voice Choir.\n\r Download my CV here.\n","date":-62135596800,"expirydate":-62135596800,"kind":"term","lang":"en","lastmod":-62135596800,"objectID":"2525497d367e79493fd32b198b28f040","permalink":"https://kevinsaude.github.io/author/kevin-saude/","publishdate":"0001-01-01T00:00:00Z","relpermalink":"/author/kevin-saude/","section":"authors","summary":"I\u0026rsquo;m currently doing research at The University of Limerick under the supervision of Dr. Rory Costello, on the origins and consequences of Negative Partisanship in Europe between 1989-2024.\nThe aftermath of the 2007-2016 decade of crises has sparked academic interest in the role that negativity plays in electoral politics (i.","tags":null,"title":"KÃ©vin SaudÃ©","type":"authors"},{"authors":null,"categories":null,"content":"\r\r Table of Contents\r What you will learn Program overview Courses in this program Meet your instructor FAQs  \r\rWhat you will learn  Fundamental Python programming skills Statistical concepts and how to apply them in practice Gain experience with the Scikit, including data visualization with Plotly and data wrangling with Pandas  Program overview The demand for skilled data science practitioners is rapidly growing.
